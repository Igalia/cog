Contributing to Cog
=======================

Thank you for considering contributing to Cog! There are different ways if
contributing, and we appreciate all of them.

- [Source repository](#source-repository)
- [Reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs)
- [Hacking on Cog](#hacking-on-cog)


Source Repository
-----------------

Cog's source repository is hosted at:

> https://github.com/Igalia/cog

Development happens in the `master` branch, which must be always buildable.


Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please report bugs at https://github.com/Igalia/cog/issues â€” you can also
browse the issues already reported, and in case someone has already reported
your bug, do not hesitate to add additional information which may help solve
it.

A general advice for bug reports is to mention the version of WebKit that
you are using, and which steps can be followed to reproduce the issue.


Hacking on Cog
-----------------

### Working on the source

Please read the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) file, which describes the
structure of the source code and some design decisions. That hopefully will
make the code easier to navigate.

### Creating and sending a patch

*(TODO: Provide some notes on how to prepare a development environment which
includes the needed dependencies.)*
### Note
This project requires libwpewebkit-1.0-dev, libwpe-1.0-dev, libwpebackend-fdo-1.0-dev 
and GTK4 for the build/run process

After cloning the project from [https://github.com/Igalia/cog] do the following 
to build and get the project running
-cd into project
-create a build directory
-cd into this directory. This is where your build files will be stored.
-run cmake -DCOG_PLATFORM_X11=ON -DCOG_PLATFORM_GTK4=ON .. to generate the build files.
-Then run the make command to generate the binaries
You just finished building cog. To run it, run COG_MODULEDIR=$PWD/modules ./cog --platform=gtk4 [https://www.igalia.com/] 
while in the build directory. If you are running Wayland, this will startup fine.

### Building and Running Cog on Ubuntu 20.04
It might generally be a bit of a problem getting and installing the dependencies 
on this version.
-In your project's root, run "sudo apt-get install libwpewebkit-1.0-dev libwpe-1.0-dev" 
to install libwpewebkit-1.0-dev and libwpe-1.0-dev.
-Next, cog requires a version of libwpebackend-fdo-1.0-dev >= 1.8.0
To get this installed, checkout the repository at [vhttps://github.com/Igalia/WPEBackend-fdo].
Switch to the wpebackend-fdo-1.10 branch(git checkout -t origin/wpebackend-fdo-1.10)
where you can find the build directory for this version.
-cd into this directory
-run meson ..
-run ninja


Pull requests should be also prepared to be merged onto the `master` branch,
except when the changes specifically apply to a release branch (like
`cog-0.1`) and do not apply to `master`. If the changes in a PR should be
backported to a release branch, link the PR in [this wiki
page](https://github.com/Igalia/cog/wiki/Release-Branches).
