Title: Contributing

# Contributing to Cog

Thank you for considering contributing to Cog! There are different ways of
contributing, and we appreciate all of them.

## Source Repository

Cog's source repository is hosted at [github.com/Igalia/cog][repo].

Development happens in the `master` branch, which must be always buildable.

[repo]: https://github.com/Igalia/cog


## Reporting Bugs

Please report bugs at [github.com/Igalia/cog/issues][issues] â€” you can also
browse the issues already reported, and in case someone has already reported
your bug, do not hesitate to add additional information which may help solve
it.

A general advice for bug reports is to mention the version of WebKit that
you are using, and which steps can be followed to reproduce the issue.

## Hacking on Cog

### Dependencies

This project requires WPE WebKit, [libwpe][], and [WPEBackend-fdo][];
and it is recommended to also have the [libdrm][], X11 and GTK4
development packages installed.

[libwpe]: https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/libwpe/
[WPEBackend-fdo]: https://github.com/Igalia/WPEBackend-fdo
[libdrm]: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/drm

The easiest way of getting the dependencies installed is using your Linux
distribution's package manager to install their development packages.
For example, on a Debian (or Ubuntu) system, the following command should
be enough:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libwpewebkit-1.0-dev libwpe-1.0-dev
```

### Building

Clone the Cog [repository][repo] and do the following:

1. Change directory to the cloned repository.
2. Run Meson to create and configure a build directory.
3. Then run Ninja to compile the binaries.

The following sequence of shell commands does the steps above:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Igalia/cog
cd cog
meson setup build
ninja -C build
```

Congratulations, you just finished building Cog!


### Running

To run Cog it, change into your build directory, and run the following
command:

```sh
COG_MODULEDIR=$PWD/platform ./launcher/cog https://www.igalia.com
```

Cog will try to guess which platform plug-in to use depending on what it finds
running in your system. If you want to manually indicate which one to load,
use the `--platform=` command line option:


```sh
COG_MODULEDIR=$PWD/platform ./launcher/cog --platform=x11 https://www.igalia.com
```

Typical values are `wl` (or the legacy `fdo`) or `gtk4` if you are running a
Wayland compositor, `x11` if you are running the X Window system, and so on.


### Creating and sending a patch

Pull requests should be also prepared to be merged onto the `master` branch,
except when the changes specifically apply to a release branch (like
`cog-0.1`) and do not apply to `master`. If the changes in a PR should be
backported to a release branch, link the PR in [this wiki
page](https://github.com/Igalia/cog/wiki/Release-Branches).
