=========================
0.13.3 - January 12, 2022
=========================

  incorrectly defined as a relative path at build configuration time.
- gtk4: Fix handling of mouse events when the device scale factor changes.
- gtk4: Improve compatibility with more graphics drivers by marking shaders
  as compatible with all GLSL versions.

=========================
0.13.2 - December 9, 2021
=========================

- launcher: Add new "--platform-params"/"-O" command line option, which
  allows passing parameters to platforms plug-ins during initialization.
- drm: Add support for output rotation by means of a new OpenGL ES based
  renderer, which can be enabled with "cog -O renderer=gles,rotation=1".
- drm: Rotate input device coordinates as needed to match output rotation.

==========================
0.13.1 - November 26, 2021
==========================

- launcher: Support setting memory limits using command line options.
- core: Remove CogLauncher from the library, as it is in practice an
  implementation detail of the cog launcher.
- cmake: Fix calculation of default installation path for platform plug-ins.

=========================
0.11.1 - November 3, 2021
=========================

- core: Changed platform plug-ins to be able to automatically detect which
  one should be used. Passing the "--platform=" command line option to the
  launcher is now optional.
- core: Added support for building against libsoup3.
- core: Added CogHostRoutesHandler, which can route URI scheme requests
  with different host parts to other handlers.
- core, cog: Added support for running in WebDriver automation mode.
- cog: New "--enable-sandbox" command line option, which allows isolating
  rendering processes from the rest of the system.
- cog: New "--content-filter=" command line option, which allows loading
  a content blocker (WebKitUserContentFilter) JSON rule set.
- drm: Implemented handling of pointer axis/wheel/finger/continuous events
  and absolute motion events.
- wl: Renamed "fdo" platform module to "wl" (Wayland) as it better reflects
  its usage; the old name still works e.g. when using "cog --platform=fdo"
  but it is considered deprecated and will cause a warning.
- wl, gtk4: Added support for fullscreening web views.
- gtk4: Honor the CogShell.device-scale-factor property.

======================
0.9.1 - March 16, 2021
======================

- core: Added CogPrefixRoutesHandler, which can route URI scheme requests
  with different path prefixes to other handlers.
- core: Added new CogShell.device-scale-factor property.
- core: Added support in CogDirectoryFilesHandler to use the URI host part
  as a path component, to ignore a certain amount of path components, and
  expose the base path as a property.
- core: Removed support for building using WebKitGTK, only the WPE port is
  supported now.
- drm: The DRM/KMS platform module is now built by default.
- drm: Added support for key press event repeat.
- drm: Added support for mouse cursor.
- drm: Added support for atomic modesetting, which is automatically used
  by default when support is detected in the video driver.
- drm: Added support for limiting the maximum used video mode width and
  height, settable using the COG_PLATFORM_DRM_MODE_MAX environment variable.
- drm: Fixed usage of the specified output device scaling factor.
- drm: Improve logging output.
- drm, fdo: Added support for SHM buffer exports, which for example allows
  using Mesa's software rasterization.
- fdo: Try using the largest available output video mode when using the
  zwp_fullscreen_shell_v1 protocol.
- headless: Added new "headless" platform module, which does not produce
  output and can be used without any graphics hardware e.g. in combination
  with Mesa's software rasterization.
- x11: Added new "x11" platform module, which uses an X11 window to paint
  rendered web content using XCB and OpenGL.

======================
0.7.1 - April 11, 2020
======================

- Support keeping a reference to the configuration file, which platform
  plug-ins can use to obtain their own configuration options.

  dependency.

  when they include passwords or fragment identifiers.
- fdo: Avoid dereferencing a NULL view backend by creating the Wayland event
  source always after a valid backend is instantiated
- fdo: Set the opaque region of Wayland surfaces when fullscreened, which
  allows the compositor to optimize redraws.

  release callback for its wl_buffer.
