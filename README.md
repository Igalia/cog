![Cog (boat)](data/cog.png)

Cog is a small single “window” launcher for the [WebKit WPE
port](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WPE). It is small, provides no user
interface, and is suitable to be used as a Web application container. The
“window” may be fullscreen depending on the WPE backend being used.

This project provides the following components:

- `libcogcore` is a library with ready-to-use components typically needed
  for implementing applications which use the WebKit WPE/GTK+ API.

- `cog` is the launcher itself, implemented using the `libcogcore`
  library.

- `cogctl` is a tool which can be used to control a `cog` instance
  using the D-Bus session bus.

It is possible to disable building the `cog` and `cogctl` programs by passing
`-DCOG_BUILD_PROGRAMS=OFF` to CMake.
